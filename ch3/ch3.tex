\section{Surface Alphas}

\subsection{Properties of Alpha Interactions}
Alpha particles are composed of two protons and two neutrons tightly bound together. They are identical to ionized Helium ions and carry a charge of $+2$ e. The energy of alpha particles is correlated with the half-life of the parent isotope, such that the ones with the highest energies are from parent atoms with the shortest half-lives. Thus, the energies of alpha particles are normally between about $4$ and $6$ MeV. For a given material, the linear stopping power S is defined as $-\frac{dE}{dx}$. The energy loss of charged particles in a material is then given by the Bethe formula:

\begin{equation}\label{bethe_formula}
    -\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{4\pi e^4z^2}{m_0\nu^2}NB
\end{equation}

such that

\begin{equation}\label{bethe_B}
    \text{B}=Z\left[ \text{ln}\frac{2m_0\nu^2}{I}-\text{ln}\right(1-\frac{\nu^2}{c^2}\left)-\frac{\nu^2}{c^2}\right]
\end{equation}

Here $\nu$ and $ze$ are the charges of the given particle, N and Z are
the number density and the atomic number of the absorber atoms, and  m$_0$ and e are the rest mass and charge of electron respectively. Parameter I represents the average excitation and ionization potential of the absorber and is normally determined experimentally. Eq. \ref{bethe_formula} suggests that the energy loss for non-relativistic particles is proportional to $1/\nu^2$, or the kinetic energy. This can be understood by noting that the smaller the velocity, the longer the particles spend in the vicinity of electrons of the material's atoms, and the higher the energy loss. Eq. \ref{bethe_formula} is proportional to z$^2$ for constant velocity. Thus heaver particles will have more energy loss for a given velocity. This results in alphas having a very low penetration depth, usually around $10$ micrometers.

Energy loss of alpha particles can be best understood by plotting specific energy loss along the track. The plot known as the Bragg curve is shown in Fig. \ref{bragg_curve_fig}. During most of the track, the energy loss increases roughly as 1/E as predicted by Eq.\ref{bethe_formula}. As the particles slow down, electron pickup reduces the charge and the curve falls off. A result of these curves is that alpha deposits a large amount of energy in a very localized area. For Germanium, the penetration depth of alpha particles is about $17.6$ - $20.0$ microns. The n+ electrode and p+ electrode in LEGEND detectors are too thick for alphas to penetrate and deposit much energy. However, the passivated surface experiences complex surface effects which are described next.

\end{figure}

% \subsection{The DCR effects}

% The behavior of alphas on the passivated is not well understood. Charge trapping and subsequent slow rerelease have been observed on the surface. These effects might be different for different detector types. For PPC detectors the electric field near the passivated surface can lead to the charges drifting along the surface. It has been shown using Monte Carlo simulations of hole drift in HPGe crystals that surface charges drift 10 to 100 times slower than bulk charges. A combination of slow drift, charge trapping, and re-release results in a slow component in the alpha signal, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dcr_waveform} 

% \begin{figure}

% \label{fig:dcr_waveform}
%   \end{figure}
  
%  This Delayed Charge Recovery (DCR) effect results in energy degradation in the alpha signal. Even though alphas are normally deposited with $5$ MeV energy, the DCR effect leads alphas to potentially contribute to the ROI. For PPC detectors, this could be understood by looking at MJD's energy spectrum, as shown at the top of Fig. \ref{fig:mjd_alpha}. The bottom plot is the difference that highlights alpha contribution in the energy spectrum. The alpha energy spectrum peaks very close to the ROI, which makes it vital to understand how to effectively model and cut alpha events. Creating a background model component for alphas needs accurate modeling of charge collection. Pulse-shaped simulations can help accurately model charge collection and build a background model for alphas.

\section{Challenges in modelling surface events}
An alpha particle deposits energy of about $4$ - $6$ MeV with a penetration depth of about $17.6$ - $20.0$ micron \cite{knoll_2010}. This excites a lot of charge carriers and produces a dense charge cloud. In such cases, effects such as diffusion of the charges and self-repulsion among charges become significant. Self-repulsion could also push the charge onto the passivated surface, leading to a slower drift and longer collection time for these charges. This slow drift is thought to be due to a combination of charge trapping and re-release near the passivated surface, and slower drift speeds due to surface properties \cite{MULLOWNEY201233}. The passivated surface could also carry a static charge, which could affect the charge collection. In experimental data, these effects manifest as an energy-degraded alpha waveform with a slow rising tail, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dcr_waveform}. This Delayed Charge Recovery (DCR) effect degrades the alpha energy spectrum, potentially contributing to the ROI. This underscores the importance of modeling alpha background as alpha events in ROI need to be rejected to have a low background.

Pulse shape simulations provide a way to perform alpha background modeling since signal formation in Germanium is well understood. A simulation to model alphas should allow for a nonspherical charge cloud while incorporating surface drift, diffusion, and self-repulsion. This warrants a dedicated simulation for surface alphas.

\section{Pulse shape simulations till now}

Signal formation in Germanium is well understood via the Shockley-Ramo theorem. This enables building accurate simulations that can model the waveforms. Simulations within the LEGEND collaboration include Siggen and SSD simulations. 

Siggen is a C-based program initially developed by David Radford at Oak Ridge National Lab for MJD pulse shape simulations \cite{siggen_paper}. It consists of two components: fieldgen and siggen. Fieldgen is used to calculate the electric potential and weighting potential of point-contact detectors in two-dimensional cylindrical coordinates. The siggen part uses the weighing potential calculated from fieldgen to generate a signal. The simulations can calculate the depletion voltage, the volume of the depletion region, and the capacitance of the detector. Diffusion in siggen is approximated using a Gaussian convolution, and there is no mechanism to account for the self-repulsion of charges as Siggen uses point charges to represent the entire charge cloud.

% A simulated event in Siggen is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:siggen_1d}.

SolidStateDetectors.jl (SSD) is a software package developed by the group of Iris Abt at the Max Planck Institute Munich for the LEGEND experiment \cite{Abt:2021SSD}. It is written in Julia and can perform calculations in all 3 dimensions. SSD can calculate electric fields and potentials outside the detectors and has the ability for parallelization. The SSD enables full 3D diffusion and model self-repulsion in the signal. The charges are tracked individually using their position and velocity.

In bulk, a spherical charge cloud model works very well, but the charge cloud produced by alpha is not necessarily spherical due to the charge trapping and re-release effect on the passivated surface. A simulation to model alpha should allow for a nonspherical charge cloud while incorporating surface drift, diffusion, and self-repulsion.

\section{{\tdsim}}

{\tdsim} are new methods to simulate surface alpha events while directly simulating diffusion and self-repulsion effects. They were initially programmed in C by David Radford and build upon Siggen simulations developed for MJD \cite{siggen_paper}. As charges drift through the detectors, they keeps track of charge densities at a pixel-by-pixel level, which allows for nonspherical charge clouds. The charges that end up on the surface have their velocities reduced by a predetermined factor. {\tdsim} also enables simulation of the effects of surface charges. The simulation is performed in r and z-direction while assuming $\phi$ symmetry— thus the charge cloud is simulated by a ring. Diffusion is performed in 2D, but the diffusion speed was checked against the diffusion speed of 3D charge clouds. The simulations need a fine grid size to account for the low penetration depth of surface alphas. The charges that end up on the surface have their velocities reduced by a predetermined factor. {\tdsim} also enables simulation of the effects of surface charges.


Fig. \ref{fig:ehd_flowchart} shows how the {\tdsim} program works. The detector is divided into a grid, and charge densities are distributed at a given location based on the impact energy, usually over two adjacent grid points. The number of density is determined using:

\begin{equation}
    \rho_H = \rho_E= \frac{\text{ E}\times 10^7 }{1000 \times 0.003 \times \text{grid}^3}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ represents the charge pair density in units of \(10^{10}/\text{cm}^3\). The deposited energy E is the deposited energy in keV, which is first converted to MeV by dividing by 1000.0. The factor of \(10^7\) is to get final unit correct. The denominator includes \(0.003\), which represents the approximate energy required to generate an electron-hole pair in Germanium. Finally, dividing by \(\text{grid}^3\) normalizes the number of generated charge pairs to the grid volume. The density for both holes and electrons are deposited equally in points (z,r) and (z+1,r).

The boundary conditions are set according to the detector geometry, impurity concentration, surface charge, and bias voltage. Then electric potential and weighting potential are calculated using an over-relaxation algorithm. The capacitance and depletion are estimated. Undepleted regions of a semiconductor detector have no net space charge and no electric field and are indicated by a local minimum in the electrical potential. The capacitance is calculated by relating two equations for the energy stored in a capacitor.

\begin{equation}\label{capacitance_eq}
C= \frac{\epsilon}{V^2} \int_{}^{} E^2 dA
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{A flow chat illustration the pseudo code for {\tdsim}.}
\label{fig:ehd_flowchart}
\end{figure}


After the initial setup, the program steps through a small time step. The charges are allowed to diffuse and then drift in the electric field. The net impurity distribution is updated based on the movement of these charges using:


\section{Diffusion}
Diffusion arises from random thermal motion of electrons and holes, causing them to spread out from regions of high concentration into regions of lower concentration. In thermal equilibrium, the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the mobility $\mu$
are related by the Einstein relation:
\begin{equation}
D = \mu \frac{k_B T}{q},
\end{equation}
where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $q$ is
the elementary charge. Thus, if the mobility $\mu$ is known or has been fit to
experimental data, $D$ may be determined for a specified temperature. In
germanium at cryogenic temperatures (e.g., $\sim 77$\,K), the mobilities are
sufficiently large that diffusion can still have a noticeable effect on the
final spread of a charge cloud, although it is smaller compared to room
temperature conditions.


Carrier diffusion in the simulation is handled by redistributing charge among
neighboring grid cells in both the radial $(r)$ and axial $(z)$ directions.
During each time step $\Delta t$, a fraction of the carriers in cell $(z,r)$
diffuse to the adjacent cells $(z\pm1,\,r\pm1)$ according to two quantities: $\delta_z$ and $\delta_r$

These fractions are computed from an approximate diffusion parameter 
$f$ and the local drift velocity magnitudes $\lvert \mathbf{v_z} \rvert$, 
$\lvert \mathbf{v_r} \rvert$ as follows:
\begin{align}
   \delta_z &\;=\; \frac{\Delta x \;\,v_z \;f}{E_z}\label{eq:deltaez}\\
   \delta_r &\;=\; \frac{\Delta x \;\,v_r \;f}{E_r} \label{eq:deltaer}
\end{align}
where $\Delta x$ is the grid size, 
$v_{z}$ and $v_{r}$ are the drift velocities, 
$E_{z}$ and $E_{r}$ are the local field components, 
and $f$ incorporates the diffusion coefficient $D$ and corrections for grid sizes.
If $E_z$ or $E_r$ is below $1\,\mathrm{V/cm}$, the code sets 
$\delta_z = 0$ or $\delta_r=0$ under the assumption that low-field regions produce negligible drift velocity.


\section{Volume Correction}

In cylindrical $(r,z)$ coordinates, each radial ring has a different 
physical area. The simulation tracks these scaling factors with arrays 
\(\texttt{s1}[r]\) and \(\texttt{s2}[r]\). In essence,
\[
\texttt{s1}[r] \;\approx\; 1 + \frac{0.5}{r-1}, 
\qquad
\texttt{s2}[r] \;\approx\; 1 - \frac{0.5}{r-1},
\]
(plus special handling at $r=1$). These scalars adjust how much 
charge diffuses into or out of the neighboring ring to ensure 
\emph{charge conservation} in cylindrical geometry. Specifically, 
if $\delta_r$ is the fraction of carriers leaving cell $(r)$ in 
the $+r$ direction, the actual increment in the neighbor cell 
$(r+1)$ is multiplied by $\texttt{s1}[r]$, while the old cell is 
reduced by the same fraction multiplied by $\texttt{s1}[r]$ to 
balance volume differences. Similarly, diffusion to cell $(r-1)$ 
uses $\texttt{s2}[r]$.

\paragraph{Charge Update}

This approach enforces that if $r$ changes by one grid index, 
the annular circumference changes from $2\pi (r-1)$ to $2\pi r$, 
or $2\pi (r-2)$ in the negative direction. Hence, we apply factors
\(\texttt{s1}\) and \(\texttt{s2}\) to rescale the transferred 
charge, ensuring the total density remains physically consistent.

After computing the diffusion fractions $\delta_z$ and $\delta_r$, 
the code subtracts those amounts from the central cell's carrier density 
and adds them to the four neighbors:
\begin{align}
  \rho^{\mathrm{new}}(z,\,r+1) &\;\mathrel{+}= \;\rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,\,r)\times\delta_r \times s_1(r) \times \frac{r-1}{r} \\
  \rho^{\mathrm{new}}(z-1,\,r) &\;\mathrel{+}= \;\rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,\,r)\times\delta_z \\
  \rho^{\mathrm{new}}(z+1,\,r) &\;\mathrel{+}= \;\rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,\,r)\times\delta_z \\
  \rho^{\mathrm{new}}(z,\,r-1) &\;\mathrel{+}= \;\rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,\,r) \times \delta_r \times s_2(r) \times\frac{r-1}{r-2}.
\end{align}
 
Because the radially adjacent cells differ in annular circumference, 
multiplying by \(\texttt{s1}[r]\) or \(\texttt{s2}[r]\) 
helps maintain overall normalization.

\section{Drift in Electric Field}

During the charge drift we calculate the electric field in r and z direction at each gird point. We then use a piecewise linear interpolation to compute the drift velocity $v(E)$ from the local electric field $E$. We define an array of electric field breakpoints, $\texttt{drift\_E}[]$, which partition the field
range into intervals. For each interval $[E_i, E_{i+1}]$, we store two quantities: a drift offset, corresponding to the drift velocity at $E = E_i$, and a drift slope which is the rate of change of drift velocity with respect to the electric field in that interval. The drift velocity is then
computed by:
\[
v(E) \;=\; \text{drift offset}[i]
\;+\; \text{drift slope}[i] \,\bigl( E - E_i \bigr),
\]
with $E_i \le E < E_{i+1}$. The fig. \ref{ch3:fig:dv_vs_e} shows the relation for the Drift Velocity verses Electric field. The dirft velocity is then multiplied by the time step to find where the charges will drift and then the charges are moved to new location.

\begin{figure}
    %[trim={left bottom right top},clip]
    \includegraphics[trim={0cm 0 0cm 0},clip,width=0.99\linewidth]{ch3/figs/ehd_dv_e.pdf}
    \caption{Relation of drift velocity verses electric field in {\tdsim}. Only 100 direction velocities are used in the current model.}
    \label{ch3:fig:dv_vs_e}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fraction Splitting}

To conserve charge when drifting carriers from one grid cell to another,
we use a splitting approach. Suppose
that after a time step $\Delta t$, the carrier density in grid cell $(z,r)$
moves to a new position with integer indices $(k,i)$ plus fractional parts
$f_z$ and $f_r$:
%
\[
k \;=\; z + \lfloor \Delta z \rfloor,\quad
f_z \;=\; \Delta z - \lfloor \Delta z \rfloor,
\]
(and similarly for the radial indices). Thus,
\begin{align}
&\text{fraction in }(k, i)   \;=\; f_{r} \times f_{z}, \nonumber\\
&\text{fraction in }(k, i+1) \;=\; (1 - f_{r}) \times f_{z}, \nonumber\\
&\text{fraction in }(k+1, i) \;=\; f_{r} \times (1 - f_{z}), \nonumber\\
&\text{fraction in }(k+1, i+1)\;=\; (1 - f_{r}) \times (1 - f_{z}).
\label{eq:bilinear-fractions}
\end{align}

Hence, if $\rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,r)$ is the charge density in the old cell,
the new distribution is updated by
\begin{align*}
\rho^{\mathrm{new}}(k,i)   &\,\mathrel{+}=\, \rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,r)\times \bigl[f_{r}\,f_{z}\bigr] \times \Gamma_{r,z},\\
\rho^{\mathrm{new}}(k,i+1) &\,\mathrel{+}=\, \rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,r)\times \bigl[(1 - f_{r})\,f_{z}\bigr] \times \Gamma_{r,z},\\
\rho^{\mathrm{new}}(k+1,i) &\,\mathrel{+}=\, \rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,r)\times \bigl[f_{r}\,(1 - f_{z})\bigr] \times \Gamma_{r,z},\\
\rho^{\mathrm{new}}(k+1,i+1)&\,\mathrel{+}=\, \rho^{\mathrm{old}}(z,r)\times \bigl[(1 - f_{r})\,(1 - f_{z})\bigr] \times \Gamma_{r,z}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Geometric Factor \texorpdfstring{\boldmath$\Gamma_{r,z}$}{}}
\label{sec:geom-factor}

In cylindrical coordinates, each cell at index $r$ corresponds to an annular
region of approximate circumference $2\pi (r \,\Delta r)$ and thickness
$\Delta z$. When charge moves from cell $(z,r)$ to cell $(k,i)$, we
often apply the factor
\[
\Gamma_{r,z} \;\equiv\; \frac{(r-1)}{(i-1)},
\]
reflecting the difference in annular volumes at radii $r$ and $i$.
The offsets $(r-1)$ and $(i-1)$ arise from one-based indexing in the code. By multiplying the bilinear fractions by $\Gamma_{r,z}$, the simulation conserves total charge when rings expand or contract in radius.In practice, near $r=0$ or $i=0$, the geometric factor $\Gamma_{r,z} \;=\; (r-1)/(i-1)$ would be undefined or negative. Hence, the actual code checks whether $r$ or $i$ is zero or one, and uses a modified factor that preserves volume scaling. 

% The factors \verb|8*r - 8| or \verb|8*i - 8| are specialized scalings to approximate the annular volume near the central axis or near $i=0$. They ensure that even when $r$ or $i$ equals 0 or 1, the total charge remains consistent with the expected geometry. For example, at the very center ($r=0$), a full ring circumference does not exist, so a smaller effective volume must be used. Although such \verb|8*-8| scalings can appear ad~hoc, they are designed to smoothly transition from the central axis to the first few radial rings, thereby avoiding division by zero while preserving charge.

\section{Surface Drift}
\paragraph{Surface Adjustments.}
If a cell lies near a passivated boundary, the diffusion can be 
further suppressed by multiplying $\delta_z$ or $\delta_r$ by a 
\emph{surface-drift-velocity factor}. This accounts for reduced mobility 
or enhanced recombination near the surface. Similarly, if the new cell 
is a \texttt{CONTACT\_EDGE} or \texttt{DITCH}, the carriers may be removed 
from the active region entirely and recorded in a variable \(\texttt{gone}\) 
to track how much charge has disappeared or been collected.


\section{Impurity Correction}
Surface events create large amount of charge carries that could impact local impurity and must be corrected to accurately calculate the electric potential. At a given time impurity corrections is given by:

\begin{equation}
  {\text{Impurity}_{t}}(z, r) = \text{Impurity}_{0}(z, r) +
  \bigl( \rho_h(z, r) - \rho_e(z, r) \bigr) \times \frac{e}{\epsilon} \times \frac{(\Delta x)^2}{2}.
\end{equation}
The $\text{Impurity}_{0}$ is the impurity of the crystal from production. $\rho_h(z,r)$ and $\rho_e(z,r)$ are the hole and electron densities respectively. $\frac{e}{\epsilon}$ is the conversion factor that relates charge density to the resulting electric field, derived from Gauss’s law in Germanium with $\epsilon = 16\epsilon_0$. $\frac{e}{\epsilon} = 11.310$ in 
charge units $10^{10}\frac{e}{cm^3}$. $(\Delta x)^2$ is the area of the grid which converts density into charge and then the conversion factor converts it into $10^{10}\frac{e}{cm^3}$ units to match the units of impurity used.

\section{Signal Calculation}
In cylindrical coordinates, each grid cell at radius $r$ and height $z$ has an approximate area proportional to $(r - 1)$. Once we read the electron 
density $\rho_e(r,z)$ and hole density $\rho_h(r,z)$ at time $t$, the weighted sums are defined as:
\begin{align}
S_e(t) \;=\; \sum_{z=1}^{L-1} \sum_{r=1}^{R-1}
   \rho_e(r,z)\,\bigl(r-1\bigr)\,\text{wpot}[r-1][z-1],\\
S_h(t) \;=\; \sum_{z=1}^{L-1} \sum_{r=1}^{R-1}
   \rho_h(r,z)\,\bigl(r-1\bigr)\,\text{wpot}[r-1][z-1],
\end{align}
where \(\texttt{wpot}[\,r-1\,][\,z-1\,]\) is the weighting potential at that grid 
point. These $S_e(t)$ and $S_h(t)$ represent the induced signal contributions 
from electrons and holes respectively via Shockley Ramo’s theorem.

The initial unweighted sums are defined as:
\begin{align}
R_{e}(0) \;=\; \sum_{z=1}^{L-1} \sum_{r=1}^{R-1}
   \rho_e(r,z)\,\bigl(r-1\bigr), \quad \\
R_{h}(0) \;=\; \sum_{z=1}^{L-1} \sum_{r=1}^{R-1}
   \rho_h(r,z)\,\bigl(r-1\bigr), \quad
\end{align}
% They keep track of how many electrons or holes remain in the crystal at time $t$ 
% (as opposed to how much they contribute to the signal).  For instance, if 
% $R_{h}(t)$ drops below $R_{h}(0)$, that implies some fraction of holes 
% has reached the collecting electrode or left the active region.

Combining these quantities, the net induced signal can be computed as
\begin{equation}
\text{signal}[\,t\,] 
\;=\;
  \frac{\,S_h(t)\;-\;S_h(0)\,}{\,R_{h}(0)\,}
  \;-\;
  \frac{\,S_e(t)\;-\;S_e(0)\,}{\,R_{e}(0)\,}
\label{eq:net-signal}
\end{equation}
By subtracting the electrons’ contribution 
(negative) from the holes’ (positive), this formula matches the typical polarity 
where holes drift toward the readout electrode and electrons may drift in the 
opposite direction. Normalizing by $R_{e}(0)$ and $R_{h}(0)$ ensures that the 
signal is expressed as a fraction of the original total electron/hole count, 
so it starts near zero at $t=0$ and approaches some final value as all charges 
arrive at the contacts.

Fig. \ref{ch3:fig:ehd_path_pd_sc0} shows a snapshot at time=$80$ns of the electron and hole clouds drift in the {\tdsim} for a 5 MeV energy deposition close to the surface with no charge. The projected density shows the distribution of the charge in the cloud. The head of each signal has a peak which is where charges would have normally traveled in point charge simulations. The tail of the projected density has a peak that is due to the slow drift of the charges on the surface. The drift on the surface, in this case, is set to be $1000$ slower than drift in bulk. This matches the range of possible effects found in \cite{MULLOWNEY201233}. 

{\tdsim} also provides several custom tunable parameters such surface charge, surface to bulk drift ration, initial energy, etc. that can be used to match the data. Fig. \ref{fig:wf_comp} shows how the output changed with surface to bulk drift and surface charge. High surface charge means that more charges will be pulled onto the surface and thus less sharp rising part will have lower magnitude. A faster surface to bulk ration means that the charges on the surface will be collected fast and so the tail shape will be different.

\section{Input and Output}

The simulation output is stored in an HDF5 file, a hierarchical data format optimized for handling large structured datasets. Each simulated event is recorded in the "event data" dataset as a compound data type containing energy, radius and height positions, surface charge, and surface drift velocity factor and the signal for the event. The dataset is dynamically extendable, allowing new events to be appended without rewriting existing data. The file includes grid size, passivated surface thickness, self-repulsion flag, and detector name as attributes. Attributes are stored as scalars at the file root level for efficient retrieval without redundancy. This storage is critical for High Performance Computing (HPC) when we simulate thousands of waveforms for multiple detectors.
