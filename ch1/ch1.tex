\chapter{Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay}

\section{Introduction}
According to the well-established Standard Model of physics, the Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter; however, the observable universe has a significant predominance of matter over antimatter. This imbalance is one of the most profound mysteries in modern physics. To explain this asymmetry, Andrei Sakharov proposed three conditions called the `Sakharov conditions' that a particle must meet \cite{sakharov_1991}. They are the violation of baryon number conservation, the violation of C and CP symmetries, and a departure from thermal equilibrium.

Neutrino is a very promising candidate that could meet all three conditions and explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry using a mechanism called Leptogenesis. In this process, a heavy right-handed neutrino decays in a CP-violating way to create more leptons than anti-leptons. This lepton asymmetry is converted into a baryon asymmetry in sphaleron processes, which violate baryon number. The expansion of the universe prevents the inverse reactions from balancing the asymmetry, so these decays occur out of thermal equilibrium, meeting the three Sakharov conditions. Neutrinos are thus fundamental to understanding the origin of matter in the universe. In this chapter, we introduce neutrino and then introduce the weak interaction that governs the neutrino behavior. We then describe some mechanisms through which neutrinos could get their mass. Then we describe the neutrino processes that can help understand the matter–antimatter asymmetry.

\section{Neutrino}
In the early parts of the twentieth century, physicists were surprised to find that the electron in beta decay seemed to violate momentum conservation. Instead of carrying the full Q-value of the decay, the electron carried a range of energies. To explain this anomaly, Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 postulated a new, light, and electrically neutral particle. Fermi later called it the neutrino because it was electrically neutral and because its rest mass was thought to be zero. It took 20 years to directly observe the neutrino in the 1956 Cowan–Reines experiment \cite{PhysRev.92.830}. Since then, neutrinos have continued to surprise physicists. The Homestake experiment in 1960 only detected about a third of the flux models predicted \cite{Cleveland:1998nv} suggesting that there was more than one neutrino. This led to a review of Pontecorvo’s theory of neutrino oscillation \cite{Pontecorvo:1967fh}. Neutrino oscillations were first observed by Sudbury Neutrino Observatory \cite{SNO:2001kpb} and Super-Kamiokande \cite{Super_Kamiokande_1998kpq} in the 1990s. 

Through the development of the theory and experimental observation, neutrinos have been found in three flavors: electron ($\nu_e$), muon ($\nu_{\mu}$), and ($\nu_{\tau}$): corresponding to the three generations of charged leptons they are associated with. Each neutrino flavor state is a linear combination of three discrete mass eigenstates, and neutrinos oscillate between the flavors as they travel through space. Experimental limits on the neutrinos' mass eigenstates are orders of magnitude smaller than those of all other Standard Model fermions, as shown in Fig. \ref{n_mass_comp}. To date, it is not known what the absolute masses of neutrinos are, and why their masses are so small. Neutrinos are hard to study as they are only theorized to interact via gravity and weak interaction. Most neutrino experiments are based on studying weak neutrino interactions, as the small mass makes gravitational neutrino studies practically impossible. We thus provide a brief review of weak interaction.

\section{Weak interactions}
The weak interaction is one of the four fundamental forces described in the Standard Model. It has a short effective range and is responsible for the radioactive decay of nuclei. In weak interaction, fermions can exchange three types of force carriers: W$^+$, W$^-$, and Z bosons. The interactions associated with the charged W$^+$ and W$^-$ bosons are known as charged current interactions, while those associated with the neutral Z boson are known as neutral current interactions. Together, these vertices form the basis for weak interactions between leptons in the Standard Model. Weak interaction does not preserve parity symmetry.\cite{wu_experiment}


% Fig. \ref{fig:weak_current} shows the Feynman vertices for each process.

% \caption{Feynman diagram showing vertices for three different kind of weak interaction mechanisms. \cite{ParticleDataGroup:2014cgo}}
% \label{fig:weak_current}
% \end{figure}

During a weak decay, different final-state particles are produced depending on the charge and mechanism of the exchanged W boson. This can be understood by considering two kinds of beta decay illustrated by Feynman diagram \ref{beta_decay_types}. A beta-minus decay with no initial charge converts a neutron into a proton in the same vertex. Thus the interacting boson has to carry a negative charge and produces an electron in that vertex. Similarly, in a beta-plus decay, the boson is $W^+$ and thus a positron is formed. Neutrinos are created based on an intermediate boson that carries the interaction. Thus there are three neutrino flavors based on the three charged leptons (electrons, muons, and tau) and their corresponding antineutrinos. 

\input{ch1/figs/beta_decay_types}


In particle physics, the Lepton number is the net number of leptons in a reaction. Particles are given a unit positive lepton number and antiparticles a unit negative. Two emergent properties from the Standard Model of Physics are that the lepton flavor and total lepton number L are conserved quantities. Lepton number conservation does not have a theoretical motivation and is not associated with any gauge symmetry. The discovery of neutrino oscillations provided the first evidence that lepton flavor is not strictly conserved, suggesting there might be physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Understanding the mechanism by which the neutrino gets its mass can provide additional evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. 

\section{Neutrino Mass}
\subsection{Dirac Mass Mechanism}
There is no mechanism in the Standard Model to give neutrino mass. One way to add a mass would be to use four neutrino fields that couple via the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs mechanism requires the existence of a right-handed neutrino field because, in the Standard Model, interaction with the Higgs boson couples opposite-chirality fields. The weak interaction is parity-violating and thus only the left-handed neutrino and right-handed anti-neutrino are produced or observed via weak interactions. They alone cannot couple to the Higgs field. It is possible that the right-handed neutrino and left-handed anti-neutrino are sterile to weak interaction, but this would not explain the relatively low observed neutrino mass limits. 

\subsection{Majorana Mass Mechanism}
A different approach is to consider neutrinos as Majorana fermions. Then the right-handed antineutrino, $\bar{\nu_R}$ could be coupled to the left-handed neutrino, $\nu_L$. Thus, the left-chiral field would correspond to the neutrino and the right-chiral field would correspond to the antineutrino, and the neutrino and antineutrino could only be distinguished by chirality. This mechanism was first postulated by the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana \cite{Majorana_1937}. Using the See-Saw mechanism, it could provide a basis for neutrino mass, and also explain why neutrinos are much lighter than any other Standard Model particles.


\subsection{See-Saw Mechanism}
The See-Saw mechanism attempts to explain the relatively low observed neutrino mass limits by including both Dirac and Majorana masses in the Lagrangian. This suggests that there would be two light neutrino and two heavy neutrino terms. The Dirac mass terms have the form of:
\begin{equation}\label{dirac_mass_terms}
-m_D(\bar{\nu}_L\nu_R+\bar{\nu}_R\nu_L)
\end{equation}

and the Majorana term will have the form of:
\begin{equation}\label{majorana_mass_terms}
-\frac{1}{2}m^L_M(\bar{\nu}_L\nu_L^c+\bar{\nu}_L^c\nu_L)-\frac{1}{2}m^R_M(\bar{\nu}_R\nu_R^c+\bar{\nu}_R^c\nu_R)
\end{equation}

Using the charge conjugation operator C, charge conjugation of the field can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{charge_conjugation1}
\nu^C=C\nu=i\gamma^2\nu^*
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{charge_conjugation2}
\bar{\nu}^C=\nu^TC=\nu^Ti\gamma^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{mass_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L}_{mass} = -\frac{1}{2}(\bar{\nu}_L\bar{\nu}_R^c) \begin{bmatrix} m_M^L & m_D \\ m_D & m_M^R \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \nu_L^c \\ \nu_R \end{bmatrix} + hc
\end{equation}

$m_D$ is the Dirac mass term, $m_M^L$ and $m_M^R$ are left and right-handed Majorana mass terms, and $hc$ is the Hermitian conjugate of the prior term. The left-handed Majorana mass term is forbidden by $SU (2)$ symmetry, so we let $m_M^L \rightarrow 0$. Diagonalizing the resulting matrix gives two effective fields: 

\begin{equation}\label{mass_lagrangian_reduced}
\mathcal{L}_{mass} = -\frac{1}{2}(\bar{\nu}_L\bar{N}) \begin{bmatrix} m_\nu & 0 \\ 0 & M_N \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \nu \\ N \end{bmatrix} + hc
\end{equation}

The resulting eigenvalues are $M_\nu \approx \frac{m^2_D}{m_R}$ and $M_N \approx m_R$. We have thus identified the mass eigenstates for neutrinos. If one of the mass terms goes up, the other has to go down, explaining the origin of the `See-Saw' nomenclature. This would explain the very small mass of observed neutrinos. The left-handed light neutrinos and right-handed light antineutrinos would be the ones observed in current experiments. The heavy right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos would have a huge phase space, thus a shorter half-life, and would have decayed quickly in the early universe. Experiments measuring neutrino mass would give insight into this mechanism. 

\subsection{Measuring neutrino mass}

There are four ways to study the neutrino mass. The first is using cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model-based spectral fit to the Planck data and other observations of large-scale structures in the universe can be used to measure the sum of the neutrino masses. The sum of masses is one of the model's free parameters, and the current limit implies a $\Sigma m_\nu<0.23$ eV \cite{Planck_2015fie}. This sum is, however, model-dependent and relies on an extensive understanding of how the universe evolved. 

A model-independent approach is to measure the mass of a neutrino kinematically. This is done by studying the endpoint of a beta decay spectrum, which would have a slight variation in shape depending on the neutrino mass. The KATRIN collaboration is performing such a direct mass measurement by looking at the tritium $\beta$-decay spectrum and has achieved a sensitivity in $m_\beta < 0.7 \text{ eVc}^{-2}$ at a $90\%$ confidence level \cite{KATRIN:2022}.

The third approach is to use neutrino oscillation experiments though these can only set a lower limit on $\Sigma m_\nu$ or $m_\beta$. The mass eigenstates of neutrinos form a complete, orthonormal basis. Similarly, the three flavors $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ form yet another orthonormal basis. Experiments indicate that these two eigenbases are rotated relative to each other. The Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix represents the unitary transformation between the two bases:

\begin{equation}\label{pmns_matrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \nu_e \\ \nu_\mu \\ \nu_\tau \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3}\\ U_{\mu 1} & U_{\mu 2} & U_{\mu 3} \\ U_{\tau 1} & U_{\tau 2} & U_{\tau 3} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \\ \nu_3 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Eq. \ref{pmns_matrix} is often expressed using three mixing angles ($\theta_{1,2}$, $\theta_{2,3}$ and $\theta_{1,3}$) and three phase angles ($\delta_{CP}$, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$).

\begin{equation}\label{pmns_matrix_expanded}
U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\ 0 & -s_{23} & c_{23} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c_{13} & 0 & s_{23}e^{-i\delta_{cp}}\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -s_{23}e^{-i\delta_{cp}} & 0 & c_{13} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c_{12} & s_{12} & 0\\ -s_{12} & -c_{12} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & e^{i\frac{\alpha_1}{2}} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & e^{i\frac{\alpha_2}{2}}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $c_{ij}=\mathrm{cos}(\theta_{i,j})$ and $s_{ij}=\mathrm{sin}(\theta_{i,j})$. This gives the probability of a neutrino of flavor $\alpha$ to oscillate to flavor $\beta$ as:

\begin{equation}\label{n_oscillation}
P_{\alpha\rightarrow\beta} = \left|\sum_i U^*_{\alpha i}U_{\beta i} e^{-i\frac{m_i^2L}{2E}}\right|^2
\end{equation}

It can be shown that Eq. \ref{n_oscillation} depends on $\Delta m^2_{i,j}=m^2_i-m^2_j$ and not on individual masses. Thus, neutrino oscillation experiments can determine the squared difference of the masses and their sign, but not the individual masses of different flavors of neutrinos. We know from experiments such as SNO that $m_2>m_1$, but no information is available about the sign of $\Delta m_{23}^2$. Thus, it is not known which neutrino is the heaviest and what the value of each mass eigenstate is. This problem is called the neutrino mass hierarchy problem. If mass $m_3$ is heavier than mass $m_2$, the hierarchy is called normal, but if it is lighter, the hierarchy is said to be inverted, as shown in Fig. \ref{mass_hierarchies_fig}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ch1/figs/mass_hierarchies.png}
\caption{Two possible neutrino mass hierarchies. In the normal hierarchy (left), the lightest mass state is \( m_1 \), followed by \( m_2 \) (separated by the solar mass-squared difference \( \Delta m^2_{21} \)), with \( m_3 \) being the heaviest, separated by the atmospheric mass-squared difference \( \Delta m^2_{32} \). In the inverted hierarchy (right), \( m_3 \) is the lightest, while \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are heavier. Figure from \cite{Hewett:2012ns}.}
\label{mass_hierarchies_fig}
\end{figure}

The fourth approach is to study the double-beta decay, which would probe the effective $\langle m_{\beta\beta}\rangle$ neutrino mass term.

\section{Double Beta Decay}
Some nuclei need to undergo a beta decay to move close to the ideal ratio of protons to neutrons; however, they are energetically forbidden to undergo such a decay. These nuclei may instead undergo double beta decay to achieve the optimal ratio of nucleons. In double beta decay, two neutrons in the nucleus are converted to protons simultaneously, producing two electrons and two electron antineutrinos. It is represented by the Eq. \ref{beta_decay_eq} and Feynman Diagram \ref{ch1:fig:2nu2beta}. It was first discussed by M. Goeppert-Mayer, and there are 35 potential nuclei in nature that can undergo this process \cite{ZUBER_2012}.

\begin{equation}\label{beta_decay_eq}
(Z,A) \rightarrow (Z+2,A) + 2e^- + 2\bar{\nu}_e
\end{equation}

\input{ch1/figs/2nbb_fd}

The necessary conditions for a $\beta$ decay are shown in Fig. \ref{2nbb_cond}. Only isotopes on the lower parabola with even-even nuclei are allowed to undergo double beta decay. The single beta decay must also be forbidden, and the decay must go through two subsequent steps. Since such simultaneous decay of two nucleons in the same nucleus is very unlikely, double beta decay is a rare process, but has remarkably been observed experimentally in $^{82}$Se with a half-life of $(1.1^{+0.8}_{-0.3})\times 10^{20}$ years by S. Elliott et al. \cite{PhysRevLett.59.2020}. It has been observed in many more nuclei since then.

Only even-even nuclei can undergo double-beta decay due to their greater stability. Figure from \cite{2nbb_cond}.}

\end{figure}

\section{Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay}
If the neutrino were a Majorana particle, it would be possible to have a double beta decay without the emission of the two neutrinos. Instead, the neutrino would be exchanged as a virtual particle such that one nucleon absorbs the neutrino emitted by another. This process is called neutrinoless double-beta decay. This scenario, which is considered the simplest possible model, is termed ``light neutrino mediated'' decay. The overall reaction would be:

\begin{equation}\label{0nbeta_decay_eq}
(Z,A) \rightarrow (Z+2,A) + 2e^-
\end{equation}


\input{ch1/figs/onbb_fd}

Fig. \ref{ch1:fig:0nu2beta} shows the Feynman diagram for the process. An observable quantity of the process is the decay rate. Using Fermi's golden rule, it can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{0nbbdecay_rate}
(T^{0\nu}_{1/2})^{-1} = G^{0\nu}\left|M_{0\nu}\right|^2\langle m_{\beta\beta}\rangle^2
\end{equation}

The phase space term $G^{0\nu}$ corresponds to a phase space into which the electron can decay. Phase space can be calculated exactly for any given isotope. $M_{0\nu}$ is the nuclear matrix element (NME), also called ``transition amplitude''. It encapsulates all of the nuclear physics processes occurring inside the nucleus and can be understood as the probability of the transition between the initial and daughter nuclei. It is difficult to know the initial and final wave functions of the nuclei, so calculating nuclear matrix elements is non-trivial and is an active field of research \cite{Menendez:2017fdf}. Finally, $\langle m_{\beta\beta}\rangle$ is the effective neutrino mass term and can be represented as:

\begin{equation}\label{effective_mjd_mass}
\langle m_{\beta\beta}\rangle =  \left|\sum_{i=1}^{3} U^2_{ei}m_i\right|
\end{equation}

$U_{ei}$ are the components of PMNS neutrino mixing. This process described above assumes an exchange of a light Majorana neutrino, but there can be other exotic physics that can contribute to the decay rate (see \cite{Schechter_1982} for an example). However, all of these processes would still imply that the neutrino is a Majorana particle.

Eq. \ref{0nbbdecay_rate} depends on the mass hierarchy and can help probe the absolute neutrino mass scale. The observed decay rate would be different depending on the neutrino mass hierarchy. Fig. \ref{majorana_mass} shows the range of $m_{\beta\beta}$ as a function of the lightest neutrino mass $m_l$ for normal ordering and inverted ordering scenarios. If neutrino masses are large compared to the size of the mass splittings, we do not expect a significant effect on $m_{\beta\beta}$ as both hierarchies merge at higher masses; however, if the neutrino masses are similar in magnitude to the mass splittings, there would be a difference in the $m_{\beta\beta}$ based on the hierarchy. {\onbb} studies provide a fourth and unique way to understand neutrino mass as they probe the effective Majorana mass $\langle m_{\beta\beta}\rangle$, and provide a direct way to measure the ordering of neutrino mass. Detecting this extremely rare process, however, requires meticulous background reduction and large-mass experiments.

\section{Detecting Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay}
Numerous experiments have searched for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), and many are presently searching for it. The measurement of interest is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two emitted electrons. If no antineutrino is emitted, the emitted electrons should carry the full energy difference between the final and initial nuclear states (the Q value of the reaction). The experimental signature of such a decay would be a mono-energetic peak in energy at the endpoint of the two-neutrino spectrum, indicating no antineutrinos are emitted, as shown in Fig. \ref{mjd_background_fig} for ${}^{76}\mathrm{Ge}$ in {\MJD}. Most $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments involve having a source of double beta decay that acts as both a source and a detector. The region of interest (ROI) is defined as the narrow energy window around the $Q_{\beta\beta}$ and is selected according to the energy resolution of the detector. Using radioactive decay theory, the number $0\nu\beta\beta$ candidate events observed in the ROI is given by: %\cite{annurev_nucl}

\begin{equation}\label{roi_candidate}
N=\ln(2)\frac{N_A}{W}\left(\frac{a\epsilon MT}{T^{0\nu}_{1/2}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, $W$ is the molar mass of the source, $\epsilon$ is the detector efficiency of the signal in ROI, and $t$ is the observed time. Using Eq. \ref{roi_candidate}, we can understand how the half-life sensitivity would depend on the detector:

\begin{equation}\label{det_sensitivity}
T^{0\nu}_{1/2} \propto
    \begin{cases}
    aM\epsilon T & \text{(background free)}\\
    a\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{MT}{B\Delta E}} & \text{(with background)}
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation}
such that $\Delta E$ is the energy resolution of the detector, and B is the background index of the experiment normalized to the width of ROI, source mass, and measurement time. The importance of low background is apparent as $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}$ scales linearly with run time t for a no background experiment compared to $\sqrt{t}$ in the presence of backgrounds.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{ch1/figs/DoubleBetaEnergy.png}
\caption{Simulated $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal in a MAJORANA detector. \cite{mjd_background}}
\label{mjd_background_fig}
\end{figure}

For a substantial probability of discovery, the experiments looking for $0\nu\beta\beta$ need to have a source as large as possible with extremely low backgrounds. At that sensitivity level, natural isotopes such as $^{222}$Rn, $^{232}$Th, and $^{232}$U can introduce background events. Cosmic rays are another potential source, along with the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay depending on the energy resolution of the experiment. Most of the experiments are thus housed underground to decrease the rate of cosmic-ray-induced backgrounds and cosmogenic activation of detector materials. They are also heavily shielded, and the experiment parts are ultra-clean. The experimental programs also need to have extensive radioactive assay studies to understand the background of their experiments.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{ch1/figs/exposure_plot.png}[!htb]
\caption{The background requirements and exposure needed for 3$\sigma$ confidence level discovery of neutrinoless double beta decay (in over $50\%$ of a collection of identical experiments), given the inverted hierarchy. Lines represent scenarios with different background levels in ROI. The blue band shows the bottom of the inverted ordering. \cite{Gruszko:2017kfx}.}
\label{exposure_plot}
\end{figure}

The $\beta\beta$ isotope used must ideally have a high Q value and a low double beta decay rate. It also must be able to be made into big detectors to increase the probability of discovery. Several isotopes are used by experiments searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay, including ${}^{76}\mathrm{Ge}$ (GERDA\cite{GERDA_final}, {\MJD}\cite{Majorana_final}), ${}^{136}\mathrm{Xe}$ (KamLAND-Zen\cite{KamLAND-Zen:2024eml}, nEXO\cite{nEXO:2021ujk}), and ${}^{130}\mathrm{Te}$ (CUORE\cite{Arnaboldi2002du}, SNO $+$\cite{SNO_paper}). KamLAND-Zen set the leading half-life limit in $^{136}$Xe with $T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 2.23 \times 10^{26}$ years \cite{KamLAND-Zen:2024eml}. 


In the coming years, the next generation of experiments will attempt to explore the entire inverted hierarchy region of Fig. \ref{majorana_mass}. Fig. \ref{exposure_plot} shows the exposure needed to achieve a $3\sigma$ discovery at the bottom of the inverted hierarchy region in ${}^{76}Ge$. The different blue lines represent background levels in counts per Region of Interest (ROI). The different background scenarios underscore the importance  for experiments to eliminate all of their background in ROI and follow the solid blue line. As the experiments increase their exposure time, the sensitivity will increase and reach the bottom of the inverted hierarchy band. The bottom of the band is shown with the shaded blue box, which is calculated using various nuclear matrix element calculations. Next-generation experiments would test inverted hierarchy space and provide new insight into the nature of neutrinos.

Thus the next decade would be an exciting time for research in neutrino physics. With ton scale experiments such as LEGEND planned 1000 \cite{legend2017}, there might be major revelations about the properties of the neutrino. We might find that neutrinos are their antiparticles, or at least that inverted ordering is not true. In that case, new experiments and possible theories must be postulated to explain neutrino mass and its interaction. Neutrinoless double beta decay will further break the Standard Model of physics. In the next section, we explore ${}^{76}\mathrm{Ge}$ as a choice of the detector and the LEGEND experiment's search for neutrinoless double-beta decay.


% To conclude, it is known that a neutrino has mass and propagates in mass eigenstates; however, the individual masses are unknown since current experiments can only probe the mass difference. The theory for how neutrinos get their mass suggests that neutrinos could be a Majorana particle. To experimentally verify this fact, one can look at a double beta decay and theorize that there could be a virtual neutrino exchange such that no neutrino is emitted and the other emitted particles would carry their energies.
