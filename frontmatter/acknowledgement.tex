This work would not have been possible without my advisor, Julieta Gruszko, to whom I owe deepest gratitude. Thank you for your patience, encouragement, and for believing in my potential when I did not.

I am grateful to David Radford for trusting me with the EH-Drift project. Your foundational work provided me with a great opportunity to learn.

Many thanks to Aobo Li for being a kind mentor and giving me the CPU-Net project. Your knowledge of machine learning has shaped my learning in the field.

I extend my thanks to the entire ENAP group at UNC, particularly John Wilkerson and Reyco Henning, who cultivated a supportive and learning environment. I would like to recognize the entire LEGEND collaboration for being an excellent and fun group to collaborate with. 

Personally, I want to thank my best friend and colleague Esteban Leon, who was a vital part of my journey. I am also grateful to my friends in Chapel Hill, Waleed, Yuma, Quique, Vale M, Vale R, Vera, Morgan, David, and Guido whose company and support made my six years in Chapel Hill a wonderful experience.

I also would like to thank my partner Leah. Thank you for always being there for me to support me and help me grow every step of the way.

I want to thank my parents Hargovindbhai and Jyotsnaben. I am here only because they took a chance on me, using their life savings to send me to the United States ten years ago. My thanks also go to my sister, Niyati, for her constant cheering and encouragement.

Finally, I also want to acknowledge the funding agencies and computing resources that made this research possible.
